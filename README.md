Grove Galileo Kit Sensors
The Grove Galileo starter kit has lots of sensors, here they are all hooked up and running.
The project reads the temp from each temp module and displays it on the LCD toggling between the
temp and the humidity, the Pot changes the temp poll rate.
The button changes the LCD color and the touch buton turns on/off the LCD.
The project is also reading the sound and light but not doing anything with the data.
